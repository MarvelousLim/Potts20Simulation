		Name agreement:

		s					array of all spins in spin-replica order
		SLF					spin lookup function for alone replica
		E					array of energies of replicas
		R					fixed population size (number of replicas)
		r					current replica number
		L					linear size of lattice
		N					fixed number of spins (N=L^2)
		j					current index inside alone replica
		q					Potts model parameter
		e					new spin value (char)
		n_i					neibors indexes inside alone replica
		n					neibors spin values
		replicaFamily		family (index of source replica after number of resamples); used to measure rho t
		rho_t				wtf value for checking equilibrium quality; A suitable condition is that rho_t << R
		energyOrder			ordering array, used during resampling step of algorithm
		MaxHistNumber		Maximum number of replicas to crease histogram from
		update              index of new replica to replace with

		To avoid confusion, lets describe the placement of the spin-replica array.
		This three-dimensional structure (L_x * L_y * R) lies like one-dimensional array,
		first goes, one by one, strings of first replica, then second etc. Here we calculate
		everything inside one replica, adding r factor later

		Also, when its about generation random numbers, we use R threads, one for each replica
